would you have a look if you have shotgun sequencing for at least some of these patients/transplants and at which timepoints? Itâ€™s for the MAIT project.
I am primarily interested in the patients in Unconventional_Hana_d30, for those I had blood samples collected on d30 and I saw some associations of microbiome and MAIT cells/unconventional T cells.

```{r}
# look at the d30 table
d30 <- read_csv('../data/Unconventional_Hana_d30.csv')

# gain access to the db
source('~/db.R')
sg <- get_data_from_query_OTU(0, 'shotgun_lookup_ad')
castori <- get_data_from_query_OTU(0, 'samples_castori_ag')
colnames(castori)
colnames(sg)
```

```{r}
subset <- castori %>% 
  filter(mrn %in% d30$mrn) %>% 
  inner_join(sg, by = 'sampleid')

colnames(subset)

subset %>% 
  distinct(mrn) %>% 
  nrow

subset %>% 
  distinct(sampleid) %>% 
  nrow

final <- subset %>% 
  left_join(d30, by = 'mrn') %>% 
  mutate(diffHCT = datecollection - hct) %>% 
  select(mrn, sampleid, diffHCT, hct, directory)


final %>% 
  write_csv('../data/Hana_shotgun_d30.csv')
```
