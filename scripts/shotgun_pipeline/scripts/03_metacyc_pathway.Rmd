Look at the smart tables of the pathway from metacyc

```{r}
ids <- read_csv('~/Downloads/All_pathways_of_MetaCyc.txt', 
                col_names = T, 
                cols(
  Pathways = col_character()
)) %>% 
  rename(PWID = Pathways)

names <- read_tsv('~/Downloads/All_pathways_of_MetaCyc_name.txt') %>% 
  rename(pw_name = Pathways)

pw <- bind_cols(ids, names)

pw %>% 
  write_tsv('../data/metacyc_pathway_name_and_ID.tsv')
```
