Look at the smart tables of the pathway from metacyc

```{r}
ids <- read_csv('~/Downloads/All_pathways_of_MetaCyc.txt', 
                col_names = T, 
                cols(
  Pathways = col_character()
))

names <- read_delim('~/Downloads/All_pathways_of_MetaCyc_name.txt', delim = ',')

pw <- bind_cols(ids, names)

pw %>% 
  write_csv('../data/metacyc_pathway_name_and_ID.csv')
```
