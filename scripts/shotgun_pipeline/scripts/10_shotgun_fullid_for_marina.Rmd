```

This is for Marina's shotgun samples : for the ones in her paper; for the ones that need strainphlan results.
Figure out what's the full ID for these samples and run them thru the pipeline right now

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(vdbR)
connect_database()
get_table_from_database('shotgun_lookup_ad')
```

```{r}
arch <- read_excel('../data/archaea sampleids sent to Austria 2022.xlsx')
shotg <- read_csv('../data/shotgun samples and collection date relative to HCT_4_13_22.csv')
length(intersect(arch$sampleid, shotg$sampleid))
both <- union(arch$sampleid, shotg$sampleid)
df <- shotgun_lookup_ad %>% 
  distinct(sampleid, .keep_all = T) %>% 
  filter(sampleid %in% both) %>% 
  mutate(full_id = str_extract(directory, 'Sample_.+$'))

df %>% 
  select(full_id)  %>% 
  write_csv('../data/marina_both_full_id.csv', col_names = F)


```
