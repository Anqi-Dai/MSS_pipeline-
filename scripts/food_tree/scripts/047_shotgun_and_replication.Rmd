To use published tool to check the growth rate of the samples using shotgun data

```{r}
# how many have been shotgun sequenced and rank by fruit consumption
library(vdbR)
connect_database(config_file = '~/dbConfig.txt')
get_table_from_database('shotgun_lookup_ad')

meta <- read_csv('../data/cleaned_stool/all_samples_meta_p2d_fg9_updated.csv') %>% 
  mutate(yes_shotgun = if_else(sampleid %in% shotgun_lookup_ad$sampleid, T, F))

yes_shotgun <- meta %>% 
  filter(yes_shotgun == TRUE)

# how doesn the yes_shotgun samples have their fruit intake ranked among all samples
meta %>% 
  ggboxplot(x = 'yes_shotgun', y = 'fg_fruit', add = 'jitter')

# get the fid for those shotgun sequenced samples 
ret <- meta %>% 
  inner_join(shotgun_lookup_ad, by  = 'sampleid')

ret$fid
