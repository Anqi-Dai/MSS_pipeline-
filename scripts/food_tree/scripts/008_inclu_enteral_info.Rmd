```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This is going to include all patients enteral info, but currently only have 67's.

# fill in the diet matrix  

```{r}
dtb <- read_csv('../data/cleaned_diet_data/FINAL_97_with_code_all_foods_drt.csv') %>% 
  select(mrn,fdrt, Meal, Food_NSC, Por_eaten:Sodium_g, Food_code:description, dehydrated_weight )

```


## create *0* counts for the entero nutrition info

```{r}
entero <- read_csv('../data/cleaned_diet_data/TPN_EN patients.csv') %>% 
  filter(mrn %in% dtb$mrn) %>% 
  rename(DayRT = Days.Post.HSCT) %>% 
  mutate(nut_type = if_else(TPN.1..EN.2 == 1, "TPN", "EN")) %>% 
  select(mrn, DayRT, nut_type)

```
 
```{r}
# to see if there is overlap between the normal diet and the above one
overlap <- entero %>% 
  inner_join(dtb67) %>% 
  distinct(mrn, DayRT, nut_type)

overlap %>% 
  distinct(nut_type)

# since all of the overlap are TPN which doesn't go thru colon, so ignore them  in the entero table
```
 
```{r}
entero_clean <- entero %>% 
  left_join(overlap, by = c("mrn", "DayRT")) %>% 
  filter(is.na(nut_type.y))  %>% 
  rename(nut_type = nut_type.x) %>% 
  select(-nut_type.y) %>% 
  select(- nut_type)
```
 
```{r}
ftb_colnames <- colnames(dtb67)
```
 
 
```{r}
# use all of the foods this patients has ever eaten as the food_nsc
create_fake_food_cts_for_enteral_patient <- function(mrn_, DayRT_){
  this_pt = dtb67 %>% 
    filter(mrn == mrn_) %>% 
    distinct(mrn, Food_NSC, Food_code, description) %>% 
    mutate(DayRT = DayRT_, 
           Meal = "fake meal",
           Menu = 'fake menu',
           Por_eaten = 0,
           Calories_kcal = 0, 
           Proteing_g = 0, 
           Fat_g = 0,
           Carbohydrates_g = 0,
           Fibers_g = 0,
           Sugars_g =0,
           Sodium_mg =0,
           dehydrated_weight = 0) %>% 
    select(all_of(ftb_colnames))
}
         
fake_enteral <- pmap_dfr(entero_clean, function(mrn, DayRT){
  create_fake_food_cts_for_enteral_patient(mrn, DayRT)
} )

```
 
## create *NA* counts for the missing days 

No need to create cuz we are gonna ignore it.


## the combined table(include fake data)

```{r}
filled <- bind_rows(dtb67, fake_enteral) %>% 
  mutate(Sodium_mg = Sodium_mg/1000) %>% 
  rename(Sodium_g = Sodium_mg)
```
