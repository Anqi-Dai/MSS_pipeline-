```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
```

can you please see if there are last-date of follow-up and vital status, relapse/POD and gvhd data for the patients in batch1 and batch2?

```{r}
pts <- read_csv('../data/pts_updated_through_june_2022.csv') %>% 
  rename_all(~ gsub(" ", "_", .)) %>% 
  rename(mrn = MRN) %>% 
  mutate(hct = lubridate::dmy(HCT))
```


```{r}

# Relapse, Relapse Date
# POD, POD Date
# Status , Last Contact
# gvhd data from the patients table
ptb1 <- read_csv('../data/cleaned_patients/diet_patients_97.csv') 
ptb2 <- read_csv('../data/129_new_76_full_patient_info.csv')

ptb <- bind_rows(
  ptb1 %>% select(mrn, hct) %>% mutate(batch = 'batch1'),
  ptb2 %>% select(mrn, hct) %>% mutate(batch = 'batch2')
)

pts_tb <- pts %>% 
  right_join(ptb, by = c("mrn", "hct")) %>% 
  select(mrn, hct, batch, Relapse:Last_Contact)

# the gvhd data
library(vdbR)
connect_database()
get_table_from_database('patient_allo_ks_20221104')
colnames(patient_allo_ks_20221104)

ptb_gvhd <- patient_allo_ks_20221104 %>% 
  right_join(ptb, by = c("mrn", "hct")) %>% 
  select(mrn, hct, batch, starts_with('d100'))

ptb_all <- pts_tb %>% 
  full_join(ptb_gvhd, by = c("mrn", "hct", "batch"))

ptb_all %>% write_csv('../data/156_combined_clinical_data.csv')
```
