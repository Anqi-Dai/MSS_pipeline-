Maybe look into GVHD yes/no (on x axis) and averaged fiber intake (on the y axis- this has to be one data point per patient)?
Another idea is to have a plot with the x-axis being time from transplant and the y axis fiber intake and color points by GVHD status (yes vs no) and add a line (geom_smooth) for GVHD yes vs no ?
If that doesnâ€™t separate well you can also look only into the lower GI GVHD vs no GVHD (remove skin, liver and upper GI GVHD).
The other idea is to look into gvhd-related mortality: divide patients in high vs low fiber (i would use data from peri-engraftment only) and the GVHD related mortality as a landmark analysis - starting at day 21 (end of peri-engraftment period) and up to 2 years. 
Just some ideas.. and hopefully that will give you some interesting results!!
